Overpowered script that allows you to assign keybinds to mouse click sequences in runescape. For example, you can assign the "e" key to equip your mage gear, switch to the magic spellbook, and cast ice barrage. New keybinds and sequences can be defined easily by editing the "event_binds" dictionary on line 171. Float values in the sequences define the sleep time between each action in the list. A small sleep time between each command (like 0.08 seconds) is recommended. New click commands can be defined in "tab_bottom_right_offsets" which maps a string to its click location offset from the bottom right of the runescape window. For example, "magic" is the magic spell book and its offset is (-20, -320) so know the program knows where to click to open the magic spellbook.
